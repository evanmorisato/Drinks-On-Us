PROJECT#3 MARKDOWN

## Drinks-On-Us
 A simple app to give you ideas on what you can drink for today. When you are tired of the ol' Rum and Coke.  
 
 I mean just go ahead get drunk, you ain’t drivin’!

## Motivation
Stuck at home in Quarantine?  Make it a day of Quarandrinkin' with our app!  

      <p> April 21, 2020,  for our final class project we were asked to create an app that can be useful to the public. 
   So we thought to scratch event apps, socialization, meetups or any public gathering (or Tindering) since everybody is quarantined.
However everybody is at home and liquor stores are open….   hmmm...<p>
